Inspiration:
My love for technology goes beyond just using gadgets. I'm fascinated by how they work and the constantly changing tech landscape. I saw a gap between eager buyers and accessible, user-friendly online stores. B-Tech Solution was born from this idea, aiming to offer a smooth online shopping experience for those looking for the latest tech products.

Challenges:
Building an e-commerce website like B-Tech Solution presented unique challenges. One challenge I faced was integrating a complex product filtering system using Wix's functionalities. I wanted to allow users to easily filter a wide range of tech products by brand, price, specific features (e.g., processor speed, RAM), and even compatibility factors (e.g., ensuring a monitor is compatible with a specific laptop). Another challenge involved ensuring a smooth mobile browsing experience for the website. 
I wanted to make sure B-Tech Solution was accessible and user-friendly on all devices, with clear product information and functionalities optimised for smaller screens.


Overcoming Challenges (STAR Method):
(Situation): Ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen sizes was crucial.
(Task): I needed to implement a responsive design that adapts the layout and elements based on the user's device.
(Action): Through extensive research and exploration of Wix's built-in responsive design features, I learned to adjust image sizes, optimise menus for touchscreens, and ensure proper text formatting across various screen resolutions.
(Result): The final website boasts a responsive design that adapts flawlessly to different devices, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience for all visitors.


Learnings:
This project was a valuable learning experience, helping me develop both technical and personal skills.
Technical: I improved my website design skills, mastering Wix's functionalities and limitations. I also learned more about e-commerce best practices, such as product presentation and user interface design.
Problem-Solving: Tackling challenges like responsive design pushed me to research, experiment, and find creative solutions, enhancing my problem-solving skills and adaptability.
Project Management: Meeting deadlines and staying organised throughout the project taught me valuable project management skills that will be useful in future endeavours.


Looking Forward:
B-Tech Solution has fueled my passion for web design and e-commerce. Moving forward, I aim to expand my skill set by exploring advanced web development languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project has underscored the importance of user experience and the power of creating visually appealing and functional online platforms. Whether I delve deeper into web development or pursue a different path, the lessons learned from B-Tech Solution will undoubtedly equip me for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
